straincompensation
==================

A simple calculator to determine necessary strain compensation thickness for quantum dots or quantum wells in a wide range of material systems.


If you found your way here you should probably go over to https://nanohub.org/resources/straincomp/ to use the most up-to-date version of this tool.

A detailed description of the inner workings has been recently published:
